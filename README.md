# Academic_group
C++_Academic_group

Write a program that allows you to form
list of students of the academic group. Interface
programs should provide the user
the following possibilities:
a. adding students to the group;
b. removal of a student from the group;
c. modification of student data;
d. academic group stamp;
e. sorting the list of students;
f. search for a student according to a given criterion;
g. saving the list of students to a file (when
shutdown of the program);
h. loading a list of students from a file (at startup
programs);
i. exit from the program.
When developing a program, you should use
two-dimensional dynamic array for storing the list
students (one-dimensional dynamic array of pointers
to objects of class Student).
